In other words, if nodes and are in the subset, then all nodes lying on the simple path between and should also be presented in the subset. After that, Peter will take the items associated with all nodes in that subset into his knapsack. Of course, the total size of those items must be less than or equal to the size of the knapsack ().\n",
